        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I am Owasimul Sidick. I attend Brooklyn Technical High School and will be a senior this upcoming year. I pursued the Software Major offered in the school and have learned to love coding. I have two pet birds named Sun and Moon (both parakeets) and love history.</p>

            <h3>My Passions</h3>
            <p>In middle school is the first time I met coding. 
                I had no idea what coding was until I used Scratch. 
                I enjoyed how I could create something out of seemingly useless text. 
                When choosing a major, my mom mentioned how as long as you know something related to technology and computers, you could not go wrong. Besides coding, I practice a bit of cardistry, card flourishing, and read about history of all types. 
                My birds are new yet I love their company, despite their fighting.
            </p>

            <h3> My Values</h3>
            <p>Culture is one of my biggest ideals. 
                I used to be fearful of my culture and if people found out about it. 
                Now, I love my culture and every aspect. 
                From food and clothing to music and movies, I have refused to give up my culture, despite how people may think of me.
                Family is also a big part of me and I have a close connection with not only my immediate family, but my extended family.
                I also keep friendships as strong as possible as I value people as a whole.
            </p>

            <h3>My Dreams</h3>
            <p>I hope to achieve something in life as a whole.
                My parents sacrificed their lives in their home country so that I may gain better opportunities.
                I don't want to be famous but I do want to be able to support myself and my family.
                I also hope that my parents can be proud of what I can achieve.
                I do wish to keep pursuing the technical field but also to keep exploring as, although software is cool, I may want to explore other fields that may interest me.
